```
Excited to open-source ConsensusAI - a portfolio management system that combines the wisdom of multiple AI advisors using a sophisticated mathematical consensus engine.

Instead of relying on a single AI model, ConsensusAI uses 4 specialized advisors (Value Investor, Macro Strategist, Risk Analyst, and Wildcard) that each bring different perspectives, then mathematically fuses their recommendations.

Key innovations:
• Multi-LLM architecture (Claude, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek)
• Rank-based consensus algorithm
• Portfolio-aware recommendations
• Production-ready with FastAPI

Built with Python, FastAPI, and integrated with Alpaca for real trading.
